And the bishops, some of whom have been harshly criticized for covering up for predator priests, adopted a broad definition of sexual abuse that includes situations that do not involve force or even physical contact. Catholic reaction included satisfaction, disappointment, and concerns that the measures would pit bishops against priests and that the policy is too harsh for a church built on the concepts of forgiveness and redemption.
